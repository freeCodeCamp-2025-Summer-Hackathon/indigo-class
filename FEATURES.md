# User Journey
## Chloe's journey

A. She finds the app (word of mouth/reference? advertising? I don't think we need to decide this currently)

B. Opens the app, gets access to the latest quote(s) right away (optional: a quick tour of the app?)

C. If she signs up with email, she can choose whether to get email affirmations

D. With email and account, she can:
- favourite affirmations
- save them in lists
- find new affirmations with categories
- customise with different background themes, fonts, etc.
- add customised affirmations (for others to find too?)

E. She feels better about her abilities day by day, collecting affirmations gradually :)
